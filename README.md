# 3D-Engine project

I started this project in 2023 working between school work and made using Java Swing.
This project was an experiement with 3D graphics and how it functioned.

# How to run/test program

The github includes the source code, to test the engine download the .rar file in the latest
release.

Controls are:\
w - move forward\
A - move left\
S - move back\
D - move right\
[left arrow] - turn left\
[right arrow] - turn right\
[up arrow] - move up\
[down arrow] - move down

Have fun!
